# odin-recipes
The first project on The Odin Project
This project is a small, basic website written using exclusively HTML. It will be a cooking website that will have an index page that houses links to certain recipes.

From this project, I learned the skills necessary to create links between pages and to set up those pages to have lists, paragraphs, headings and even images. 

One thing I will try and remember from this project is to always check your boilerplate because I nearly missed that there was a title that had not been updated. This would have looked rather foolish had it been published!
